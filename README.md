<h1> UX UI Design Challenge </h1>

<h2>What we learnt this week:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This week at the School of Code it was UI/UX week.</li>
  <li>We heard from a number of different guest speakers who were either employers or employed in the fields of UX and UI.</li>
  <li>We learnt about the Disney rooms and went through the ideate process, attempting to put ourselves in the dreamer room, realist room and finally critic room.</li>
  <li>We created user stories and used Hubspot to create user personas.</li>
  <li>We used draw.io to create user flowcharts.</li>
  <li>We made use of colour palette selectors like coolors to help us select colur palettes that work.</li>
  <li>We used Miro to create low-fidelity wireframes and Figma to create high-fidelity wireframes.</li>
  <li>We used lighthouse to view accessibility scores of websites and thought about how important accessibility is and how designing an inclusive app/website can benefit everybody.</li>
  <li>We also learnt some advanced CSS, adding variables to the root for ease of editing and flexboxes for positioning.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Our Task:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>We were tasked with dreaming up a business, my partner and I were both ex-teachers so we decided that childcare would be appropriate.</li>
  <li>We went through the design thinking process that we had learnt about during the week to think about our users and design a product and landing page to suit their needs.</li>
  <li>You can see our jamboard which documented our journey by clicking <a href="https://jamboard.google.com/d/17tD6D6Nxx6oH3NRlGr60qm6ntE9w1IAXECRjBlgm_28/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
    </ul>
  
  <h2>Main learning points:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>I hadn't realised how much work goes into the organisation of any given app or website.</li>
  <li>There is so much research into the user, whoever they may be, their needs and what they need from the product before you even start thinking about what it will look like or the functionality of it.</li>
  <li>It is so important to know your user and have accurate research!</li>
  <li>The process isn't linear, it should be agile to ensure that you are meeting the needs of the user. The user should always be at the heart of everything you do.</li>
  <li>Everything is thought about, every click anticipated and a good website/app is designed with the user journey in mind.</li>
  <li>Colour is important, it is best to start with a couple of complimentary colours and use them sparingly, it is also important to think about your colourblind users to ensure that important colour contrasts are visible to them.</li>
  <li>Wireframes are a fantastic tool, starting out with low-fidelity, simply thinking about the layout of your page without any colours or actual text really helps you to focus on the layout as a stand alone thing. Using these wireframes, with a pre-selected colour palette, makes it much easier to create the high-fidelity version and the benefit of having this to work off whilst you create your webpage is amazing.</li>
  <li>My partner had to leave for a meeting so I took on the challenge of starting to create our landing page using html and CSS. Flexboxes were invaluable throughout this process and although the page isn't fully finished, I am really pleased with the progress that I have made on it and how similar it looks to the page that we designed together. I wouldn't have been able to position the elements as accurately if I had been asked to do this last week.</li>
